## About Me
I try to learn everything I find interesting. There is no limit of my field of interest. Some people say it is bad for me to try to learn everything. But I say __SCREW THAT__ :trollface:
<br/>
currently I am learning and doing some small projects (Which are not impressive)
You can say that I am a `Lv10` programming wizard and `Lv7` tinker :toolbox:
